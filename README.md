# CSE-401_Computer-Graphics-and-Animations
Here I have utilized modern OpenGL for different computer graphics problems.
For Lab test 1:
Task 1 Problem: Show an OpenGL Program which will show a triangle with red color where each edge will be of length 3 with background color blue.
Task 2 Problem: Show an OpenGL Program which will show one triangle with green color and length of 0.4 aligned in y axis which will be overlapped with another triangle with blue color and length of 0.2 aligned in z axis with white background using 2 VBO and 2 VAO. 

For Lab Test 2:
Task 1 Problem: Show an OpenGL program with embedded vertex and fragment shader which will show one red colored 2D triangle where red color will be sent via uniform variable.
Task 2 Problem: Show an OpenGL program which will show a 3d cube which will change its size 1.2 times and change its location +1 in one axis from time to time.
Task 3 Problem: Show an OpenGL Program which will show four different overlapping 2d squares with four different colors and are always rotating and changing locations at different rates.

For Lab Final:
Task 1 Problem: Show an OpenGL program which will show:
a) Hello Triangle/Shapes: Two 2D Triangle
b) Shader/Texture: Two different colors for each (Sent via vertices).
c) Transformations and Coordinate System: Their size will change using keyboard.

Task 2 Problem: Show an OpenGL program which will show a less shinny 3d colored cube which will be lighted by another 3d white colored cube where:
a) Camera: Camera will change its zoom from time to time.
b) Lighting: 20% ambient lighting + 20% specular lighting.
